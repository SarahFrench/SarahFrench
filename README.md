### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
    -  [HugoHermanWilson.com](https://www.hugohermanwilson.com/) : a website for âœ¨ baritone âœ¨ opera âœ¨ singer Hugo Herman-Wilson
        - Made using React, Gatsby and Netlify, with Netlify's headless CMS
    - Contemplating totally redoing the above in Next.js instead of Gatsby
    - Improving my Go knowledge
- ðŸŒ± I recently achieved a GCP Associate Cloud Engineer certification!
- ðŸ§µ To get me away from screens, I'm currently dabbling in embroidery
